Italiana was designed for use in the headlines of newspapers and magazines. Italiana is inspired by the calligraphy of the Italian masters. It is suitable for design solutions that require elegance and sophistication. It was conceived with modern proportions that make it great for economical typesetting both on paper and on screen.
